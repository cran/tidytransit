## GTFS Table Relationships

## Additional tables calculated by tidytransit


In addition to the tables described above, tidytransit attempts to calculate the following tables when one uses read_gtfs():

### Simple Features

- routes_sf
- stops_sf

### Frequencies/Headways

- routes_frequencies_df
- stops_frequencies_df

tidytransit prints a message regarding these tables on reading any GTFS file. 

```{r}
# Read in GTFS feed
# here we use a feed included in the package, but note that you can read directly from the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority using the following URL:
# nyc <- read_gtfs("http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/google_transit.zip")
local_gtfs_path <- system.file("extdata", 
                               "google_transit_nyc_subway.zip", 
                               package = "tidytransit")
nyc <- read_gtfs(local_gtfs_path, 
                 local=TRUE,
                 geometry=TRUE,
                 frequency=TRUE)
```

## Example GTFS Table Joins

### Route Frequencies to Routes

For example, joining the standard routes table, with the 'route_shortname' variable to routes_frequencies_df. 

```{r}
routes_df_frequencies <- nyc$routes_df %>% 
  inner_join(nyc$routes_frequency_df, by = "route_id") %>% 
          select(route_long_name,
                 median_headways, 
                 mean_headways, 
                 st_dev_headways, 
                 stop_count)
head(routes_df_frequencies)
```

You can do the same with 'simple features tables'. 

For example, under the hood, plot(gtfs_obj) is doing this:

```{r}
routes_sf_frequencies <- nyc$routes_sf %>% 
      inner_join(nyc$routes_frequency_df, by = "route_id") %>% 
          select(median_headways, 
                 mean_headways, 
                 st_dev_headways, 
                 stop_count)
plot(routes_sf_frequencies)
```

### Headways at Stops for a Route

A more complex example of cross-table joins is to pull the stops and their headways for a given route. 

This simple question is a great way to begin to understand a lot about the GTFS data model. 

First, we'll need to find a 'service_id', which will tell us which stops a route passes through on a given day of the week and year. 

When calculating frequencies, tidytransit tries to guess which service_id is representative of a standard weekday by walking through [a set of steps](https://github.com/r-transit/tidytransit/blob/master/R/frequencies.R#L34-L59). Below we'll just do some of this manually. 

First, lets look at the calendar_df. 

```{r}
head(sample_n(nyc$calendar_df,10))
```

Then we'll pull a random route_id and set of service_ids that run on Mondays. 

```{r}
select_service_id <- filter(nyc$calendar_df,monday==1) %>% pull(service_id)
select_route_id <- sample_n(nyc$routes_df,1) %>% pull(route_id)
```

Now we'll filter down through the data model to just stops for that route and service_ids. 

```{r}
some_trips <- nyc$trips_df %>%
  filter(route_id %in% select_route_id & service_id %in% select_service_id)

some_stop_times <- nyc$stop_times_df %>% 
  filter(trip_id %in% some_trips$trip_id) 

some_stops <- nyc$stops_sf %>%
  filter(stop_id %in% some_stop_times$stop_id)
```

Before we plot them, lets pull the frequency calculations from the calculated table onto their geometries. 

```{r}
some_stops_freq_sf <- some_stops %>%
  left_join(nyc$stops_frequency_df, by="stop_id") %>%
  select(headway)
plot(some_stops_freq_sf)
```

We may--in fact, we probably will--see some surprising outliers for headway calculations in this plot. 

Calculating headways at stops is tricky for a number of reasons. One reason is that these calculations can be determined by schedules of service. 

But hopefully now you have a better understanding of how you can use the GTFS data model to communicate about these questions.
